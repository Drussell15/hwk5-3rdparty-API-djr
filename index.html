<!-- I took the homework and changed it up more as a here is what i have planned -
later I would like to add the ability to record times in (like a project tracker that I could use as I teach high school from home due to the quarintine so I have a method of documenting my time for my supervisor.)
another feature I would like to expand on is making it weekly and then be able to export the data out of the program so it can be read by a program like open office. -->
